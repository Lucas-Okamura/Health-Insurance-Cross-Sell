# 1. Context

A Health Insurance company is analysing the possibility to offer their clients a new product: a car insurance. As well as the health insurance, the clients of this new product should pay annually to obtain a certain value assured by the company, for their cars. The company surveyed nearly 380,000 clients about the interest in joining a new car insurance product last year. All clients showed interest or not in purcharsing the new insurance product and these responses were saved in a database along with other client attributes. The product teams selected 127,000 new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive an offer of the new car insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through phone calls. However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20,000 calls within the campaign period.
